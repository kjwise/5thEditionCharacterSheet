11. 05. 2017:
Now entering a graveyard close to the underground pyramid where
we meet ghouls that we shall fight.

The tiny hafling is peeing himself with fright.

I call upon Mystra to protect me from the evil ghouls and I step forth
and give them the fingers.

My ally, Eyvindur takes a few rotten punches to the family jewels.

I go for the kill on the ghoul that wounded me, but I manage only to slightly pad it's
rotten cheek with my warhammer.

However, all are disposed of properly.

According to messages I sense from Mystra we have now looked at everything in this area.

We go back to the Feather Tower. We see a town far away being drowned in water and storm.
I comfort the prisoners, the hafling looks for a giant weasel and then we rest.

LONG rest

We go back to the Stone Temple and prepare to fight some bullheads with axes.

The Monk starts a fierce attack, faints to the right, goes to the left and delivers a critical
electrifying strike to the side of one of the monsters. After which he strikes with his left palm
and stuns the beast. The orc and allies finish it off.

I thunderously strike the other beast, knocking it back 10 feet and prone.
I follow through and vehemently smite it in the face.

Enraged, the beast stands up but fails its reckless attack against me.
We quickly dispatch it, and the bard materializes a round void in the minotaur
using the immense power of Mystra.

We finally get through the locked magical door in the stone temple.
Inside is a very powerful undead, probably a Lich.
We retreat, as it allows us to leave, thinking us far beneath him.
I grow mad at myself and how week my clan is.

After this, we go down, break a nearly impossible to break portcullis
and then we get into yet another fight. This time, we are properly outnumbered.
I foresee that my hammer will be soaking in even more blood.

We endure a spell of shatter, it hurts.

The hafling makes yet another stupid decision, while the weasel weasels away.

The monk hits the wounded Ogre that has jumped us right in the eye and kills it.
It's always nice to have one less ogre to worry about.

The orc takes down the other Ogre. We are in fine shape.

I venture forth while dodging like a phantom beast, avoiding all attacks.
This happens in the middle of an area filled with foes.

My might is great. Mystra is great.

I will show them all how hurting is done.
I am surrounded by 2 priests and a heavily armored man in plate mail.
I kill the priest, each with a single swing of my hammer.
Then I face the man in the plate, and get slightly hurt by his swings.

With bolts of energy, heavy handed sword swings, electric spear and a hafling's
lucky shot, my plated man is killed in the most painful of ways.

The mob has thinned, quickly. We look around for what blood remains to be shed
and then we shed it.

Then it is back to corridors, rooms, left, right, forward. This reminds me of
the years growing up in the magical hallways of B.

Having finally found more enemies to murder and maim, Volen releases her frustration
and obliterates a mailed man, hits another and then becomes restrained.

The battle is a mess, but I manage to reach the priest that is commanding the Earth
and I give him a good smacking. He still stands and I feel the magic throwing through him.

After a bout of madness and few hits from the rest of us, the priest attempts to flee,
however, the weasel wouldn't want any of that and killed the frightened bastard.

Now we need to get the bloodied orc to safety, Volen is surrounded by a wall of metal,
embattled by 3 black platemen. I consider cooling them down.

My skills fail me, Volen retreats but is felled. The situation is becoming dire.
Not noticing what is going on around me, I run towards Volen and the enemy that downed him.
I pray to Mystra and I lay my hands on Volen. My faith restores her back to a somewhat vital state.
Flummoxed, Volen takes two good strikes at the foe, hurting him badly.

We kill the metalheads. I smite the last one to smithereens.

We let the hafling glide down the shaft into the depths of darkness.
As we eagerly await for a message, we hear the faint sound of a gong being struck weakly.
The floating stone starts to move down and we jump on it to catch a ride - hopefully down to
our brave little soul.

Meanwhile - the brave little ranger that struck the gong is aware of how stupid that action was.
Something dangerous is approaching!

...

And we dispose of the fire breathing cows.
