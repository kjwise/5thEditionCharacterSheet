Stones fall out of wall
5hp damage

Carrion crawler attacks me and misses!
I disengage away from the monstrosity, although I truly hate it
and ready to destroy it as I cast hunters mark on it.

The monster attacks Google the Bugbear and poisons it so that it is paralysed!
I knew it was wise to step away from it. I also don't particularly trust that
bugbear, so if he dies, I won't shed tears.

The cat however, seems to hold it's own as it managed to hurt the monster.

I take good aim at the monster and hurt it bad! The cat then finishes it off.

We take a short rest, while some take the monster apart for goodies.
I recover my lost hp (1 hit die used)

I dream about drow being ensnared in my trap.
